## General Information
- Very simple and straightforward UFC Fight outcome predictor using Python3 and my own fight breakdown algorithm
- As Mixed Martial Arts is also a sport, the outcome of any fight is impossible to predict with 100% certainty, so please **DO NOT** rely on this program for betting purposes
<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->


## Technologies Used
- Beautifulsoup4
- Tkinter
- ufcapi - [Link](https://github.com/FritzCapuyan/ufc-api)


## Setup

Must have Python3 installed in the system to operate
```
pip install -r requirements

cd ./UFC-Versus
or
dir ./UFC-Versus

py run.py
```


## Improvements:
- include technical aspects of fighters for the generated outcome
- better UI/UX
